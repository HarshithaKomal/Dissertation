classic jazz!","a poem by 
i love jazz music 
it reminds me of bjork and 
eating chocolate covered strawberries from the 
fork 
legendary jazz singer 
i have known frank sinatra since my parents 
listened to him a few years ago. 
having milk and cookies during christmas 
listening to jazz music for santa 
reminds me of new jersey’s ‘jersey boys’ 
i am listening to symphonic jazz saxophone 
while studying 
i am drinking mocktail at the night club 
relaxing jazz, old but gold 
blues musician nat king cole 
jazz is power of music 
i meet michael bublé at a restaurant 
new york city is the hometown of jazz 
the beatles walking the abbey road 
groovy in the 1950’s 
shhh... oh, so quiet. 
i know there is a girl named ashley, playing 
saxophone 
she’s so great! 
jazz is very common in ballrooms 
i can see them dancing on the stage 
looking at the landscape and watching them 
perform 
classic jazz!",1

they have to do it on time 
cause of good future they work hard 
when they are rich it seems like the king sitting on the throne 
this is all about work hard life 
don't be lazy like the turtle walking 
time’s never waiting for you 
if you spend the right time 
your future shines like the sun 
don't make your like dark like sleep in the dark room 
because it will not give you gold 
please make your life like a lamp disappear the darkness 
it can make you be on the throne.",1
